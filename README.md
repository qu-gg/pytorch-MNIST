# PyTorch MNIST Implementations
Implementation of varied MNIST architectures to test PyTorch
------------------------------------------------------------
fc_model.py: A simple 3-layer network used to test the basics of loading the MNIST dataset and executing a training loop
conv_model.py: Similar in structure to the FC model, just with the addition of convolutional layers and the ability to use the network for custom predictions.
